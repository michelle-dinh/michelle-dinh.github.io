    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
   <p>As a growing artist, I am always open to new ideas. Many of my works play around with different media and techniques in order to create a pretty successful experiment. I enjoy storytelling and creating narratives, which I cannot often express on paper. Art has given me a chance to write an invisible narrative that may be legible or go a complete direction depending on the audience’s reaction to it.</p>
    <p>I was fascinated since the introduction of the computer, but I never realized how much it would impact my career path. Art has become a source of self-expression. It was a way to showcase my creativity in multiple media instead of being constricted to one. When I found out that my interest in art can be combined with technology, I thought that I found the right path. I started from making videos using Windows Movie Maker to being at SJSU, filming, directing, and editing my videos using Adobe Premiere Pro. 
    I chose to be a major in Digital Media Art because I wanted to explore deeper into the mechanics and technological side of art. I was interested in learning how to code, how to make videos, 3D modeling and animation, creating video games, and so much more. Digital media has become more than just an aesthetic, it has become my third language.</p> 
    <p>In the future, I want to inspire and teach others that the capabilities of digital media art. I find that it can unleash my excitement to be expressive and creative as new emerging technologies continue to be more advanced as time goes by.</p>
