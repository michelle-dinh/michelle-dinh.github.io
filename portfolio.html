            <h5>My Kind of Coffee, Autodesk Maya, 960 × 540px. {1 min loop, no sound}</h5>
            For this project, I decided to revisit my bunny-alien character and use him in another context. I wanted to use an object that was familiar, so I went with a coffee mug. This animation is fairly simple. Repetition and overlapping made it possible to make a 1 minute loop. They all commonly make their way into the coffee mug. The movements between each character varies, as it reciprocates different energy levels that make up a cup of coffee: hyper, slow, and jumpy.

            This 3D print was made from a 3D model designed that I created in Autodesk Maya. The goal was to be familiar with the concept of 3D printing and how these transformations are being translated from screen to real life.

            Logline: Two people are given a chance to meet their soulmate via text message and looks forward to the days coming forth.<br>
            A collaboration project with Andrew Mai who also helped film, direct, and edit the final version. The objective was to create a logline and a 3-5 minute narrative. It was my first attempt filming a longer video. It was rewarding to see how it came out in the end.

            Extendo Boosts is a pair of prosthetics that adjusts an individual's height using a remote control and allows the them to reach objects that seem to be out of their reach. With a adjustable strap attachments at the base and a criss cross metal structure, the individual is safe and stabilize when using it. The bottom base is slightly larger and has a concave that fits the the top base, allowing them to merge perfectly into one piece.

            <h5>A Loop with Variations, Adobe Premiere Pro, 1920 x 1080 px.</h5>
            For my final cut, I used 1 created material (the background) and 5 found green screen elements. I had a lot of fun experimenting with composition and deciding when things should loop and multiply. I found that by choosing the soundtrack first, it made it a lot easier for me to figure out the placement and timing of things. Overall, I'm happy with how it turned out and I hope you enjoy this loop!

            <h5>A Gamer's Story, Adobe Premiere Pro, 1920 x 1080 px.</h5>
            For this video, we were required to work in pairs. I teamed up with my classmate, Andrew Mai, to film a minute long interview with my little brother, Derrick. In this interview, he talks about what gaming means to him. 
            I mainly handled the B-roll and editing process while my partner worked the main camera. I did not know how much went into creating an interview and how cutting clips became my best friend.

            <h5>Santana Row Timelapse, Adobe Premiere Pro, 1920 x 1080 px.</h5>
            I decided to head over to Santana Row and create a time-lapse of the how it is at night. I used an intervalometer and stayed at the location for over an hour each. I took at least a total of 2000 photos with an interval of 3 seconds. Although the process was pretty time consuming, I really liked how the outcome turned out.

            The second animated gif was not too difficult at all to do. For this gif, I did not have to worry about the background not looping, but I wished I filmed the background even longer, so that it would appear even more seamlessly. What I had a hard time with was timing and spacing for the found green screen elements. I focused on making sure that the frames and movements were exactly the same. Although the looping gif seems simple, it took a lot of time to get it almost right.
